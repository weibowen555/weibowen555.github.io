      My research spans trustworthy and interpretable AI for large language models.  
      I develop prototype-based, symbolic, and explanation-driven methods to make model behavior  
      transparent, fair, and robust, enabling users to understand and trust AI decisions in high-stakes settings.  
      In parallel, I study reinforcement learning and post-training techniques that distill multi-agent reasoning  
      into single, verifiable agents—improving reasoning quality, evidence attribution, and causal grounding.  
      Together, these directions aim to advance AI systems that are both interpretable in their inner logic and  
      competent in autonomous, evidence-based reasoning.
