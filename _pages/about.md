## Research Interest

My research centers on trustworthy AI, with interpretability at its core. I design models and tools that help users understand how AI systems reach their decisions. I also study related challenges in security, fairness, and agent design, aiming to keep AI agents reliable and protected against misuse. Ultimately, I seek to create AI systems that work well in practice while remaining transparent, fair, and resilient.
