# About Me

Hello! My name is Bowen Wei, and I am a third-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at George Mason University. I am fortunate to be advised by Professor Ziwei Zhu.

My research spans trustworthy and interpretable AI and agentic reinforcement learning (RL) for large language models. I develop prototypebased,
symbolic, and explanation-driven methods to make model behavior transparent, and robust, enabling users to understand and
trust AI decisions in high-stakes settings. In parallel, I study RL and post-training techniques that distill multi-agent reasoning into single,
verifiable agents—improving reasoning quality, evidence attribution, and causal grounding. Together, these directions aim to advance AI
systems that are both interpretable and competent in reasoning.
